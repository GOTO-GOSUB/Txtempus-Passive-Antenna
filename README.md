Passive antenna boards for Txtempus

Still a work in progress, these are boards to simplify connecting an antenna to a Raspberry Pi when using Txtempus.

The standard part is approximately the same shape and size as a Pi Zero and gives a fairly large surface area with which to apply your own antenna, such as a tuned ferrite mounted to the PCB via cable ties and self adhesive bases.

The compact part will fit inside an official Pi Zero case.

Please be sure to download the correct board for your region.
