# Txtempus-Passive-Antenna
Passive antenna boards for Txtempus

Still a work in progress, these are boards to simplify connecting an antenna to a Raspberry Pi when using Txtempus.

The standard part is approximately the same shape and size as a Pi Zero and gives a fairly large surface area with which to apply your own antenna, such as a tuned ferrite mounted to the PCB via cable ties and self adhesive bases.

The compact part will fit inside an official Pi Zero case.
